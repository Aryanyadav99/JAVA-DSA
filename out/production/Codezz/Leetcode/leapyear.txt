// leap year 
if you think 4 is suff for leap year divisibility then you are a fool 

it is true for some instance but thats not valid for century years(repeated after 100 year)

..some sentray year is divisible for 4 but not a leap year 

so there is a extra condition for centuary year 
 if(no is not divisble by 4 then confirmly not a leap year)
 if it is divisibe for then we have to find some more detail for centuary year 

 so for century it must be divisble by 100  then we got centuary year so it musstttttt be divisible with 400 for getting a leap year
