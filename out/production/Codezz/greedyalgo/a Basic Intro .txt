// OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS
--opti problems are those prob which requre  min or max result final 

--for any problem there are many solutions
--and having some fessile solution means those sol which satisfying constrains(condition)
--but there is only one optimal solution (opt sol are those sol which is already fessible and gave us the best result(ex-min oe max among all))
--opt sol are those which satisfy the objective of problem 

There are three ways for solving the OPTIMISATION PROBLEMS

1..greedy meathod
2.. Dynamic Programing
3..branch and bound
..some problem can be done by 1 or 2 or 3 and some can be done by all or any two 

// Greedy meathod shows that the problem solved in stages 
..in each stage we found first local sol by taking the greedy choice (which is fessible and optimal for that stage )
..then by clubbing all these local sol we can get the global solution(optimal sol)



Basically in greedy algorithm you have to be take a greedy chioce in small steps

pacticle example :- a company take interview 
r1 online test 1000 student select top 100 student that is called local sol
r2 interview test 100 student selelct top 20 student local sol for that round
r3 hr intervire test 20 student top 10 selected local sol for that round
from all these local we get final soln thats called global solution
and company done all of this by greddy approach...

1...They are mostly used in optimaising problem means final soln may be min or may be max;
2...Most of them use sorting borfore approach
3...there is no fixed rule
pros 
..simple and easy
..tc is good enough
cons
.. a lot of time global optium is not achieved thtas why we apply it on very particular questions
then we some other techniques like dp and branch bound
