Aline of person/object is called queues 
its just the horizontal view of stack 
first col is called front adn last is called rear 
it is FIFO datatype structure first in first out 
entry is from rear(back) side 
exit is from front side 
*** rear when array is empty rear index is -1 and front is 0 we always do all opertions with rear

basic opertaions on queus

1.Add() tc 0(1) --also called enque
fornt hamesa first wala rahega add ham rear ki madat se karege intisilally puri list khail hogi 
to front and rear same hoge then rear ko next me point kara ke elemnts add karte jayege

2..Remove() tc0(1) --also called dequeue(means que se bahar niklna)
fornt ki value hatae jao aur front ko age batate jao
deque -a term study further means double ended queue means entry and exitst from both direction

3..peek() tc0(1)
it means watch the value of front ;


implementation 

it can be done by linked list ,array,arraylist,stack 
by array:->
array have a fixed size draw back and remove opertioon have tc 0(n)so
so its not advised to use array as a ques implementation but we can use it in circular queue 
..
