BST is evovlvded versiom version of binary tree where search time complexity become very less in most of the cases 
in binary tree we got tc of searchimg 0(n)...n is no of nodes of tree
int Bst we got tc of searching 0(h)...h is the height of thats tree in average cases int height is become  log n for comopletely balanced tree 
used for fast lookup
What is BST?
similar to binary tree with some addition tree (like we can compare with binary search type (means sorting id imp left<root<right))
1.. every single left node is less value of root node
2... every right node is more value of root nood
3.. every subtree satisfy the bst property
4.. there are no duplicates  ***

.. the inorder sequence of the bst gave us the sorteed sequence excluding null or -1;

-> concept of searching 
similar to binary search 
compare thtas key with root to nkow wheather kew is gretaer or samller 
if key is greter search on right subtree
if key is lesser than root search on left subtreerepeat the same process 
.. worst case with balanced tree (average cases) ..key is at any leaf so its tc is 0(h)
for balaced time complexity its (h is logn)
... worst case (skeweed tree)kewal ek taraf root  then (h is eqal to n)

STRAtEGY .. recursion
.. Most problem solved using recursion by dividing into sub problems
