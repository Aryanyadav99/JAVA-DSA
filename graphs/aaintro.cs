1.. Graph is an network of nodes .. liike parent of tree 
2.. every nodes are called Vertices and line connecting to them is called edge
3.. real life example is maps

.. now some edges 

1.. unidirectoinal edges -- one way 
2.. undirected edge -- have no direction  and some time called bidirrctional edge
3.. bidirectional --two way

on bases oon direction and weight we have graphs

.. evvery edge have a weight(it is value associated with edges)..

For storing graph we want some structure for representation 

There are many ways for representation
1..Adjacency list  -- most popular way to representation  (it is list of list)
2..Adjacency Matrix
3..edge list4.
4..2d matrix (implicit graph)


Adjacency list is a lsit of list
it can be created throght 
1..ArrayList of ArrayList
2..Array of ArrayList
3..hashmap of vertex and list 

 but moslty in java we use array of list for our representation
