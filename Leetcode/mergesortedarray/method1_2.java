package Leetcode.mergesortedarray;

// the merging of sorted is simply done by using a temp array 

//but this is a diierent ques the ques id that you have to given two array and you have to preform such operation in both of then that they are ready to merge without any disturbance means after that we can simply merge one part + another part without and operation perform 

// but the twist is that you didnt have to use any extra space 

// for ex  array1[1,5,7]  and array2[2,6,9] 
// after solving we have array lilke 

// array1[1,2,5] array2[6,7,9] so we can simply do array1 +array2 

// one way to solve like simple merging in another array and copy the half in 1 and another in 2 its good in tc and best way but it take space 

// and interview want you to not use space instead you use some extra time 

// this can be done by using two methods 

//1 is put a pointer in array 1 at last and in 2 at begin then traverse 

// and second is to apply gap method  liike shell sort 

// code is not prive here but the logic is in copy and striver shhet and code is not too diif to write
