    // the second type of problem stats that find the ele of givrn row in a list

    /// but its tc is 0(c*0(r));
    /// 
    /// instead of finding the factorial for all there is an pattern in the pascal trsaingel in every row 
    /// 
    /// the pattern is that that first ele is always 1 ad the then there is multiple of some some thing on moving forward 
    /// 
    /// and the mutiple with (row-(deno))/deno 
    /// 
    /// deno (col-1)
    /// 
    /// but make sure the consideration of row and col is strt from 1 
    /// 
    /// and the code is written in leetcode find in striver dsa sheet and logic detail in copy
